The GPIB-USB-HS+ may require a one-time firmware initialization.  If the adapter
requires firmware, it will have a product id of 0x761e.  The product
id changes to 0x7618 after the adapter has been programmed.

The firmware initialization may be
performed by plugging the device into a Windows computer with the
NI drivers installed.  Alternatively, you may use the hsplus_load program 
under Linux to upload the stage1 and stage2 firmware located in this 
directory.  The hsplus_load program is available at
