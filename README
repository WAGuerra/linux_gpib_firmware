The firmware can be uploaded to the device with the fxload
program, and generally needs to be uploaded each time the device is
plugged into your computer.  udev rules which perform this upload
are included as part of Linux-GPIB.

NI GPIB-USB-HS+:

The GPIB-USB-HS+ may require a one-time firmware initialization.  If the adapter
requires firmware, it will have a product id of 0x761e.  The product
id changes to 0x7618 after the adapter has been programmed.

The firmware initialization may be
performed by plugging the device into a Windows computer with the
NI drivers installed.  Alternatively, you may use the hsplus_load program 
under Linux to upload the stage1 and stage2 firmware located in the 
ni_gpib_usb_hsp subdirectory.  The hsplus_load program is available at
