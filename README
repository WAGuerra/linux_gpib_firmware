This repository contains firmware for various devices
supported by Linux-GPIB.  See the README in the
appropriate subdirectory for more information:

NI GPIB-USB-B	(subdir ni_gpib_usb_b/)
NI GPIB-USB-HS+	(subdir ni_gpib_usb_hsp/)
Agilent 82357A and 82357B	(subdir agilent_82357a/) 
Agilent (HP) 82341C and 82341D	(subdir hp_82341/)
Agilent (HP) 82350A	(subdir hp_82350a/)

Linux drivers for these devices are available
as part of the Linux-GPIB package at 

https://linux-gpib.sourceforge.io

Some of the devices have udev rules included in Linux-GPIB which 
will automatically load their firmware.  To use such rules,
make sure the Linux-GPIB rules are in /etc/udev/rules.d (or
at least symlinked there).  Also you will need to copy
the firmware files to wherever the gpib_udev_fxloader 
script installed by Linux-GPIB expects to find the
firmware for your device (in a default configuration it would be a 
subdirectory under /usr/local/share/usb/).
