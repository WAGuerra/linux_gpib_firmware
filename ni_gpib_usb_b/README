The firmware files can be uploaded to your NI GPIB-USB-B adapter
using fxload.  Example:

fxload -D /dev/bus/usb/001/002 -I niusbb_firmware.hex -s niusbb_loader.hex

The firmware must be uploaded to the device every time it is powered on.
There are udev rules included as part of Linux-GPIB
which can perform this upload automatically.

Thanks go to Michael Ritzert for figuring out how to extract the firmware
from a usb sniff log.  The log that was used is included
(file name is "ni-usb-b-initialization-log.txt"), as well as the perl 
script for creating the hex file ("firmware_extract.pl").
